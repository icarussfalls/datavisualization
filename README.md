Trading strategy was built with ML ensemble models.

This is a simple trading dashboard built with Flask and Plotly to showcase trades data and performance over time.

The data is stored in a SQLite database and fetched using pandas library for further analysis and visualization using Plotly library.

The dashboard currently contains a Trades page which displays a table of all trades and a cumulative profit/loss graph over time.
